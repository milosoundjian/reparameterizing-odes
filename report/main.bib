  abstract = {Scalings form a class of group actions that have theoretical and practical importance. A scaling is accurately described by a matrix of integers. Tools from linear algebra over the integers are exploited to compute their invariants, rational sections (a.k.a. global cross-sections), and offer an algorithmic scheme for the symmetry reduction of dynamical systems. A special case of the symmetry reduction algorithm applies to reduce the number of parameters in physical, chemical or biological models.},
